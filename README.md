Description:
	The goal of the project is to display information about chronic disease in the United States of America
	between the years of 2007-2013. Each team member provided a different method of visualization with a csv file called U.S._Chronic_Disease_Indicators__CDI_.csv which was obtained from the Center For Disease Control Website. The three visualizations made were a sortable bar graph, a color map showing the concentration of a specific disease per state, and a color plot that display the prevelance of all listed disease (from the CSV file) per one selected state.
